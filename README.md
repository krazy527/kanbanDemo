✨ KanbanFlow: Your Interactive Task Management Hub ✨
Welcome to KanbanFlow! This project brings you a sleek and intuitive Kanban-style task manager, meticulously crafted with React, TailwindCSS, and the power of DndKit for seamless drag-and-drop functionality. Experience effortless task organization with persistent storage, all powered by a mock REST API using JSON Server.

🚀 Core Capabilities
Dive into a rich set of features designed to streamline your workflow:

✏️ Dynamic Task Management: Easily create, modify, and remove tasks as your needs evolve.
📊 Clear Task Stages: Organize your work across three distinct states: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
🖐️ Intuitive Drag & Drop: Effortlessly move tasks between columns to reflect their current status.
🔍 Smart Search: Quickly locate tasks with a debounced search bar that filters by title.
🎨 Modern & Responsive UI: Enjoy a clean, visually appealing interface built with TailwindCSS.
🛠️ Technology Powering KanbanFlow
This dashboard is built upon a foundation of modern and efficient technologies:

Frontend Framework: React (bootstrapped with Vite) for a dynamic user interface.
Styling: TailwindCSS for a utility-first approach to beautiful design.
Drag-and-Drop Magic: DndKit, providing a smooth and accessible drag-and-drop experience.
Mock Backend: JSON Server simulating a RESTful API for task data persistence.
State Handling: Core React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing application state.
Visual Accents: React Icons for clear and intuitive iconography.
📂 Understanding the Project Layout
The codebase is organized for clarity and maintainability:

📁 src

┣ 📂 components   // Houses reusable UI elements like TaskCard, Column, etc.

┣ 📂 hooks        // Contains any custom React hooks developed for the project.

┣ 📂 utils        // Stores utility functions, such as the debounce mechanism.

┣ 📄 App.jsx       // The heart of the application, orchestrating all components.

┣ 📄 main.jsx      // Entry point for rendering the React application.

┣ 📄 db.json       // The JSON file acting as the database for JSON Server.

┣ 📄 index.css     // Global styles and TailwindCSS base configuration.

┣ 📄 tailwind.config.js // Configuration file for TailwindCSS.

🧑‍💻 Get Started in Minutes
Follow these simple steps to get KanbanFlow up and running on your local machine:

📥 1. Obtain the Source Code
Clone the repository to your local environment:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/krazy527/kanbanDeno.git
cd task-dashboard
📦 2. Install Necessary Packages
Fetch all the project dependencies:

Bash

npm install
🌐 3. Launch the Mock API (JSON Server)
First, ensure JSON Server is installed globally. If not, run:

Bash

npm install -g json-server
Then, ignite the server:

Bash

json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
Your mock API will be accessible at: http://localhost:3000/tasks

▶️ 4. Run the React Application
This project utilizes Vite for a fast development experience. Start the development server:

Bash

npm run dev
The application will be live at: http://localhost:5173

✅ How to Use KanbanFlow
Navigating and using the dashboard is straightforward:

Create a New Task: Click the "➕ Add Task" button to bring up the task creation form.
Modify or Remove a Task: Interact with the task to edit or to delete any existing task.
Reorganize Tasks: Simply click and hold a task, then drag it to your desired column (To Do, In Progress, Done).
Find Specific Tasks: Utilize the search bar at the top to filter tasks by their titles. The search is debounced for performance.
🧱 Architectural Insights & Design Choices
Modular by Design (Component-Based): The UI is constructed from distinct, reusable components (e.g., TaskCard, KanbanColumn, AddTaskModal), promoting maintainability and scalability.
Seamless Drag-and-Drop with DndKit:
@dnd-kit/core establishes the foundational context for all drag-and-drop operations.
DragOverlay is employed to render the visually appealing floating task effect during drag actions.
API Communication: Standard Workspace API calls manage all Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations with the JSON Server backend.
Task Data Structure: Each task in the system adheres to a simple JSON format:
JSON

{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Sample Task",
  "status": "todo"
}
(Note: status can be "todo", "inprogress", or "done")
Optimized Search Experience: A custom debounce utility is implemented to delay the search filter execution by 500ms, preventing excessive API calls and improving UI responsiveness during typing.

🧪 Roadmap for Enhancements
While KanbanFlow is already a capable tool, here are some ideas for future development:

🌟 Task Prioritization & Due Dates: Implement features to set task priorities and deadlines.
💬 User Feedback: Add toast notifications to confirm API actions (e.g., "Task created successfully").
💾 Persistent Order: Save the specific order of tasks within columns after dragging.
🔧 TypeScript Integration: Migrate to TypeScript for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
📱 Mobile Responsiveness: Further refine the design for optimal viewing on mobile devices.
🔐 User Accounts: Introduce user authentication for personalized task boards (optional).
⏳ Performance for Scale: Implement pagination or lazy loading to efficiently handle a large number of tasks.
